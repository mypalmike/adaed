This repository is intended to archive the source code and documentation for the Ada/Ed project at New York University.

Ada/Ed began as an "executable specification" for the evolving Ada
language standard, and was originally written in SETL. Later Ada/Ed
was rewritten in C, which was available on a wide range of
computers. The original SETL version was also translated to SETL2, the
language designed by W. Kirk Snyder.
