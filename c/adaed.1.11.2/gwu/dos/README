This directory contains only the source code (in C) for the DOS
version of NYU Ada/Ed (nyusrc.zip) and the GW-Ada/Ed editor
environment (gwusrc.zip). This source code is free software,
released under the GNU General Public License.

The binary distribution has been re-packaged, with no change in
functionality, and moved (as the files adaed1.zip and adaed2.zip)
to the ez2load directory. This is located at ftp.gwu.edu, in the
directory pub/ada/ez2load, and at the Public Ada Library,
wuarchive.wustl.edu, in the directory languages/ada/compiler/ez2load.

Please see the README file in that directory.
