----    Program : First.ada--    Purpose : This program is a "first" Ada program, similar to C --              "Hello World" program.  It is intended to help the user--              start using the GWUMON program by providing a program--              which would be easy to get up and running.----    Take the default options on the first screen (speed = 6, exceptions = yes,--              and tasks = no) by hitting the "Esc" key.  Take the defaults on--              the second screen (Small window, line tracing, and no procedure--              tracing) by hitting the "Esc" key again.--    Now the monitor should be running, stopped at the first executable --              statement, the elboration of name.  Hit the space key until--              the program asks for your name.  Type in your name, then --              hit return.  Continue to hit the space key until the program--              completes execution.----    To use this program with GWUMON, from the DOS command line, type:--                       adacomp -a -b -mfirst first.ada--                       gwumon -mfirst--WITH Text_IO; USE Text_IO;PROCEDURE First IS  String_Size : CONSTANT Natural := 30;  Name : String(1..String_Size) := (Others => ' ');  Return_Size : Natural;BEGIN  Put_Line( "Please type in your name");  Get_Line( Name, Return_Size );  Put_Line( "Hello, " & Name );END First;
