ABOUT THE GW-Ada/Ed-Mac DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT GW-Ada/Ed-Mac is a development environment built around the New YorkUniversity (NYU) AdaEd compiler/interpreter. It allows the editing,compiling, binding and execution of Ada 83 programs. GW-Ada/Ed-Mac wassupervised by Prof. Michael B. Feldman. Manuel A. Perez, a GWU doctoralstudent in Computer Science, is responsible for the Macintosh version,including the editor and developer shell. We are finishing a good usermanual; in the meantime, please bear with this sketchy version. We thinkthe system will be fun to use and as easy to work with as most Mac programs are.NYU's original README file is included in the distribution, for yourinformation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------II. ACQUIRING AND INSTALLING GW-Ada/Ed-Mac FROM AN FTP ARCHIVE System requirements - a Mac with a 68030 or 68040 processor, System 7, andat least 4mb of RAM. You should have around 10mb free space on your harddisk, too. We have not tested with System 6 or with a 68020 processor. Youare welcome to try, but we make no promises. You need to copy and download four files, in addition to this readme: -rw-r--r--   1 mfeldman users      24329 Jan 21 15:56 readme.nyu-rw-r--r--   1 mfeldman users     155782 Jan 21 15:14 adaprogs.sea.hqx-rwxr-xr-x   1 mfeldman users    1227749 Jan 21 14:42 gw-adaed.sea.hqx-rw-r--r--   1 mfeldman users      11907 Jan 21 16:05 userman.macThe first file is the original NYU document for Ada/Ed; you don't need itto run this system, but it contains useful background information. Thelast file is a brief user manual for GW-Ada/Ed-Mac; you can open it withany ASCII editor or Word Processor; we recommend that you open it with theGW-Ada/Ed-Mac editor, once you've installed the system.The files gw-adaed.sea.hqx and adaprogs.sea.hqx are BinHex-edself-extracting Stuffit archives. Once you've downloaded the files to yourMac, you need to use the BinHex utility program to un-encode them. BinHexis a free program that you can pick up from any Mac archive or user group. The next step is to unpack the archives. The un-BinHex-ed files should nowbe in the form of Stuffit archive icons. All you need to do isdouble-click on the archive icons. You will be given a file-selectiondialog to choose where to install the stuff; typically you will install iteither in the desktop or at the root level of your hard disk. Install botharchives and continue reading this document. The folder named "GWU AdaEd Folder" contains a file icon "GWU Ada"with aversion number. This is a double-clickable application. The other filesare not. Do NOT move or otherwise disturb these files! GW-Ada/Ed expectsto find those files, and behavior will be unpredictable if you mess withthem. The folders GWUDemos, NYUDemos, and Spider contain sets ofinteresting programs to de,onstrate the capabilities of GW-Ada/Ed-Mac andof Ada in general. GWUDemos was produced by GWU, NYUDemos by NYU, andSpider by John Dalbey of California Polytechnic State University at SanLuis Obispo.Once all four folders are available on your Mac, start reading the usermanual, which gives a brief tutorial on using the system.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
