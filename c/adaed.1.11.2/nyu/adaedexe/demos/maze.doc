This directory includes two demonstration programs:

	hilbert		draws Hilbert curves until terminated by CTRL-BREAK
	maze		draws a random maze and uses tasking to find a
			solution (if one exists), or reports non-existence
			of a solution.

Both programs use the ANSI.SYS driver for the screen and so your
CONFIG.SYS file must contain the line
		DEVICE=ANSI.SYS

Batch file RUNC.BAT compiles both demonstration programs, and then
executes the maze demo. Either can then be executed again by typing
	adaexec -m draw -l demolib
for the maze demonstration, or
	adaexec -m hilbert -l demolib
for the hilbert curve demonstration; type CTRL-BREAK to end the
hilbert program.

The directory demolib and its contents can be deleted when the demonstration
is complete.

The maze program asks for two inputs:
	num_lines	number of lines to draw in creating maze
	rand_seed	seed for random number generator; if zero, the
			seed is determined from the current time of day,
			otherwise the value give is used. The table
			below shows combinations which result in a maze
			for which there is a solution.

The RUNC.BAT batch file is set up to read sample values from file MAZE.DAT.
Not all combinations result in a maze for which there is a solution!
