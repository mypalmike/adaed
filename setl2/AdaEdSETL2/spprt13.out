    6   -- PURPOSE:
    7   --     THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS CONSTANTS OF TYPE SYSTEM.ADDRESS.
    8   --     THESE CONSTANTS ARE USED BY SELECTED CHAPTER 13 TESTS,
    9   --     BY PARTS OF THE AVAT SYSTEM, AND BY ISOLATED TESTS FOR
   10   --     OTHER CHAPTERS.
   11   
   12   -- MACRO SUBSTITUTIONS:
   13   --     $VARIABLE_ADDRESS, $VARIABLE_ADDRESS1, AND $VARIABLE_ADDRESS2 ARE
   14   --     EXPRESSIONS YIELDING LEGAL ADDRESSES FOR VARIABLES FOR THIS
   15   --     IMPLEMENTATION.
   16   
   17   --     $ENTRY_ADDRESS, $ENTRY_ADDRESS1, AND $ENTRY_ADDRESS2 ARE
   18   --     EXPRESSIONS YIELDING LEGAL ADDRESSES FOR TASK ENTRIES
   19   --     (I.E., FOR INTERRUPTS) FOR THIS IMPLEMENTATION.
   20   
   21   --     IF NO EXPRESSIONS CAN BE GIVEN THAT ARE SATISFACTORY FOR THE
   22   --     VALUES OF THESE CONSTANTS, THEN DECLARE SUITABLE FUNCTIONS
   23   --     IN THE SPECIFICATION OF PACKAGE FCNDECL, CREATE A PACKAGE BODY
   24   --     CONTAINING BODIES FOR THE FUNCTIONS, AND REPLACE THE MACROS WITH
   25   --     APPROPRIATE FUNCTION CALLS.
