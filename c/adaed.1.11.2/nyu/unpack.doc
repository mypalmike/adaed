The Ada/Ed-C system version 1.11.2 for 386/DOS machines is packaged 
using the Zoo archiver, Version 2.01. There are two Zoo files adaedexe.zoo 
and adaedsrc.zoo. In addition Dewar's Advanced Syntax Checker (DASC) is 
included in this distribution. It is a very fast syntax checker which detects
the first syntax error in the program if any and then stops. To run simply
type "DASC filename". DASC without any arguments will list the options.

adaedexe.zoo contains the executables, demo programs, README, RELEASE.TXT, etc
adaedsrc.zoo contains the sources and makefile to rebuild the system

adaedexe.zoo is all that is necessary to compile and execute Ada program.

To unpack simply copy both the zoo.exe and the appropriate zoo file to your 
hard disk and then simply type

    zoo x// adaedexe.zoo
or
    zoo x// adaedsrc.zoo

Then look at the README and RELEASE.TXT files for further instructions.
